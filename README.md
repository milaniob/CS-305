**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**
    Artemis Financial provides clients with online financial assistance. They help with developing financial plans for retirement, savings, invenstments, and insurance. They are looking for software security as they develop their web-based software. Our goal is to check for vulnerabilities and provide feedback to help increase security. 

**What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?**
    Overall, I think I did well in understanding the software requirements and having the right aapproach from the start. The value of secure communications to the company is very high as secure communications are key to overall success. It helps sustain customer confidence in the company and assure their confidence that their privacy is secure. 

**What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?**
    Working through the vulnerability assessment, it was challenging just because it was new. Despite being new, there were a lot of resources to help. The best resource was all of the information given by the Maven Dependency checks. They clearly outlined issues and explained them in a way that anyone could read. 

**How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?**
    The need to increase layers of security often came down to the dependency check. It was the best way to assess the given code and refactor as needed. 

**How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
    Consitent testing throughout was an easy way to make sure the code was functional and securing before and after refactoring code. 

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks? Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer? **

    An important tool that I used that will help me for future assignemtns and tasks and in the work place is consistent usage and checking on API documentation. The dependency check provided me with a lot of sources that can help understand why there are certain issues and how I can go about making improvements. Consistently checking these resources will help future coding as that increased knowledge will help me make the correct decisions, write the correct code, and recognize issues earlier.
